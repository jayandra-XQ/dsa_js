Understand Asymptotic analysis and notation


What is Asymptotic Analysis?
Asymptotic Analysis is the big idea that handles the above issues in 
analyzing algorithms. In Asymptotic Analysis, we evaluate the performance 
of an algorithm in terms of input size (we don't measure the actual running time). 
We calculate, how the time (or space) taken by an algorithm increases with the input size



How to calculate Time Complexity.
no of line execute = time complexity

directly depend on input
array = [20,4,5,31,49,10] 
element - 6 
inputs - 6

Asymptotic Notations. -- big(o), theta, omega


f(n) = 5n2square + 6n + 12

variable,space = space complexity

time complexity depend upon number of input
