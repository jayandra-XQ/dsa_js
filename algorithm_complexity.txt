Algorithm basics...
What is Algorithm complexity...
Time complexity:
 -- The time complexity is mainly calculated by counting the number of steps to finish the execution


Space complexity:
---space complexity is the amount of space required to solve a problem

Space complexity = Auxiliary space + Input size.


Big O notation: Use to denote complexity(both)
